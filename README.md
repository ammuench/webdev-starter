# Webdev Starter Guide
A list of resources and guides for new web developers

## Start Here!

I'd recommend starting with some oneline interactive tutorials just to get a base-level feel for web development/programming in general.  This shouldn't require any setup on your end other than a web browser to go through the online course.

Codecademy is an online code tutorial service that does a lot of great intro work.  You won't need an IDE or local environment setup, as most of their tutorials are all done with an online web console

It's super useful for just learning some bare-bones basics, and most of the intro courses are free!

## Setting up your Computer

If you've done the courses and want to progress, the next thing you'll want to do is set up your computer to be able to write code!

Some basic things you'll want to have as you start progressing into web development are:

* an IDE
* a terminal
* NodeJS
* Git

### IDE

An IDE is an "Integrated development environment", and is essentially a text editor with a bunch of extra tools/features to help make writing code easier.

**My main recommnedation for web development is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).**  It's an free, open-source IDE made by Microsoft and has a lot of great features out of the box.

If you want alternatives, the other big 3 are:

* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) (free)
* [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) (free 30-day trial, free for students, license around $70)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) (free)

Find one that you like best, and feel free to tweak it with themes/plugins as you go along to make things easier for you!

### Terminal

#### MacOS and Linux

Good news, your machine has a basic terminal already built in!  You should be all set here.  I would [recommend adding ZSH to your terminal](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH) if you don't already have it setup as it adds a bunch of quality of life plugins!
