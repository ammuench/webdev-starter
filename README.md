# Webdev Starter Guide
A list of resources and guides for new web developers

## Start Here!

I'd recommend starting with some oneline interactive tutorials just to get a base-level feel for web development/programming in general.  This shouldn't require any setup on your end other than a web browser to go through the online course.

Codecademy is an online code tutorial service that does a lot of great intro work.  You won't need an IDE or local environment setup, as most of their tutorials are all done with an online web console

It's super useful for just learning some bare-bones basics, and most of the intro courses are free!

* [Learn CSS Basics](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css)
* [Basic Website Creation](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/make-a-website)

## Setting up your Computer

If you've done the courses and want to progress, the next thing you'll want to do is set up your computer to be able to write code!

Some basic things you'll want to have as you start progressing into web development are:

* an IDE
* a terminal
* NodeJS
* Git

### IDE

An IDE is an "Integrated development environment", and is essentially a text editor with a bunch of extra tools/features to help make writing code easier.

**My main recommnedation for web development is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).**  It's an free, open-source IDE made by Microsoft and has a lot of great features out of the box.

If you want alternatives, the other big 3 are:

* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) (free)
* [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) (free 30-day trial, free for students, license around $70)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) (free)

Find one that you like best, and feel free to tweak it with themes/plugins as you go along to make things easier for you!

### Terminal

#### MacOS and Linux

Good news, your machine has a basic terminal already built in!  You should be all set here.  I would [recommend adding ZSH to your terminal](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH) if you don't already have it setup as it adds a bunch of quality of life plugins!

#### Windows

On Windows, you can get by on using CMD, but I highly recommend installing the new Windows Subsytem Linux Terminal.  It's created by Microsoft and adds a full native Linux bash shell to the system.  It will make working with NodeJS MUCH easier.

[Here is a good instruction on how to set it up on Windows 10](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/trying-the-new-wsl-2-its-fast-windows-subsystem-for-linux).  I would recommend using Ubuntu as the Linux system if it's your first time using a Terminal.

Once it's setup, it will work just like an OSX or Linux terminal.

### NodeJS

NodeJS is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.  It's heavily used in a lot of web development projects as a task runner, package manager, and much more.

You can download NodeJS and [install it for your system here](https://nodejs.org/en/). 

However, if you're on OSX, Linux, or setup the Window Subsystem Terminal from the last step, I **strongly recommend** using NVM (Node Version Manager) to install NodeJS on your system.  This will install it without running into many common permissions issues, and also allow you to install and manage mulitple versions (which can sometimes be helpful for older projects you may need to run).  

[You can install NVM and get instructions here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)


### Git

Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.  It allows you to save and track changes incrementally as you work on your project, which allows you to both work on code-bases collaboratively and be able to revert and restore changes at any point in your code history.

It also allows you to clone and download the codebases of other people, which will be helpful for work.

If you're on OSX or Linux, you likely have git installed already.  [If you're on Windows you may need to go and install it from their website here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

In many tutorials that will be added here, I will try to provide instructions for git via commandline.  [However, if you want to use a GUI system to manage git, I would recommend GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)

## Next Steps!

I will be adding to this guide in the coming weeks to provide good next steps to continue after working on the above...watch this space!
